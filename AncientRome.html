                            <p>During this time Romans began to notice that bad smells, unclean drinking water, sewage and dirt made people become ill and in order to combat this they built aqueducts to carry clean water into their cities, public baths, toilets and sewers were all built in order to give Ancient Romans a way to clean themselves and the toilets were connected to sewers so all waste was removed from the city.</p>

                            <h1>Claudius Galen</h1>
                            <p>Claudius Galen was a Greek physician who believed that illness was caused by imbalances of the four humours. Galen developed the idea of opposite humours for counter-balancing the bodyâ€™s humours. Galen was the person who discovered that the brain is what controls speech not the heart. He also found that arteries and veins carry blood through the body. Despite Galen's discoveries he also made a few mistakes and this was mostly because Galen could not study the human anatomy but had to substitute the human body for that of animal bodies.</p>

                            <p>Doctors during this time recommended more exercise, changes in diets or prescribed herbal medicines as opposites. Also during the this time doctors were quite expensive for most people so it was common for the head of the family to look after their household. Due to this they would use herbal remedies and common sense methods.</p>

                            <p>Surgery at this point in time mainly consisted of bleeding. Internal operations were still rare at this point in time because of the risk of surgery. The other surgery that was conducted rarely was amputation with that addition of trephining which was where they would drill a hole into a patient's head in order to relieve pressure.</p>
