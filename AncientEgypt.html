                            <p>During this time period the Egyptian society was an agricultural society that was based along the River Nile. Due to this society being based along the River Nile, the Nile floods benefited the society as it fertilised the fields. This in turn benefited the society as it meant there was spare food so more people were healthy. Which then meant that more people could become doctors and other professionals. The ancient Egyptians were the first to really document their knowledge of medicine which was then used as a guide for future time periods.

                            <p>Due to the way the Ancient Egyptians benefited from the River Nile they began to believe that the human body was full of channels. They believed that when you became ill it was due to one of the channels being blocked. They used methods such as purging, vomiting and blood-letting to unblock these channels. Although a lot of the Egyptian society believed in this method most of these ideas weren’t accepted by all.

                            <p>During this time the egyptian gods played a very crucial role within their society as they believed that their gods could cause disease but also be the cure. Priests were amongst the majority of the Ancient Egyptian society and these priests kept books which detailed accepted treatments and spells. These books also contained instructions on what to do when talking to a patient with exact instructions on what to do, say and what medicine to give the patient.

                            <p>Ancient Egyptian believed that when a person dies their body was needed in the afterlife so they began the practice of mummification. This was the process of preserving human bodies. To begin with they would remove all of the soft organs form the body and dried the remainder of the body with salt. With this process it gave the Ancient Egyptians some knowledge towards the anatomy of the human body. Due to the Egyptians believing the body was needed in the afterlife any experiments that would have been performed to potentially learn more were not allowed. This was because they believed that this is destroying a person’s body which meant they would not be able to go to the afterlife.
