                            <h1>Theory of Four Humours</h1>
                            <p>The Theory of the Four Humours was thought of by a man named Aristotle. Aristotle suggested that the body was made up of four humours and these were blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. This four humours were also linked to the four seasons and four elements. This theory is the belief that these needed to be in balance in order to have good health. With this theory treatments were developed in order get rid of excess humour by purging, vomiting or blood-letting.</p>

                            <h1>Hippocrates</h1>
                            <p>Hippocrates is often referred to as the father of modern medicine. This is because he belived in natural causes of diseases and encouraged other doctors to treat illness using natural methods. Hippocrates also came up with the method of Clinical observation. This is simply where the doctor would observe all of the patients symptoms and then commence treatment once they have an understanding of the problem. The hippocratic oath is an oath that was founded based off of the beliefs of Hippocrates. The oath is still used today by doctors and the oath is a promise made by doctors stating that they will obey the rules of behaviour in their professional lives.</p>

                            <p>The Ancient Greeks was another period in time where they believe in Gods and thought that they had a part in illness. These is known because Temples called Asclepions and people would go and stay there when they would become ill. The visitors who visited the temples would bathe, relax and pray to Asclepius the Greek God of Healing. Whilst they slept at the temple they believed a God would come to them in a dream and cure them. Whilst patients were visiting the temple the priests would perform rituals which often involved placing snakes onto the patients.</p>

                            <p>The library of Alexandria was a library that attempted to collect all the knowledge of the world. The library of Alexandria was one place within Ancient Greece that human dissection was allowed. Alexandria was famous for the training of medics and surgeons. Once they were done being done trained at Alexandria they went on to practice all over the world.</p>
                            <p>Erasistratus was a Greek anatomist and royal physician who founded the school of anatomy in Alexandria. One discovery that was made by Erasistratus at the library was that difference between arteries, veins and nerves. His discovery found that nerves were not hollow so could not be vessels for fluid.</p>

                            <p>Surgery advanced only slightly during this time period but this was because it was still a risky procedure. Although most treatments were performed outside of the body so surgery was not always required it was used as a last resort if those treatments proved ineffective. Surgeons at this time developed good techniques for setting broken bones and in extreme cases of this would amputate. During this time a range of surgical instruments were also developed and this were made of iron, steel and brass.</p>
