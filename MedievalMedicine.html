                            <p>Christian churches grew stronger in the Middle Ages. Monasteries controlled education, priests and monks were the only people who were allowed to read. The church open medical schools where the idea of Galen were taught.  Libraries were only available in the monasteries and the church occasionally banned books they did not want people to read.</p>

                            <p>With mediaeval hospitals medical care was provided for the poor set up by the monasteries. The hospitals were run by monks and nuns, they provided hospitality for all visitors, although genuinely ill patients were often turned away due the fear of disease spreading.</p>

                            <p>During this time Galen's ideas were rediscovered by the church leaders. They looked carefully at his work and decided that it was correct and that it fitted in with Christian ideas. This was mostly because he referred to “the creator” in his work. Galen had great influence on the Doctors in the Arabic world and in mediaeval Christian Europe.</p>

                            <h1>Four Humours Theory</h1>
                            <p>Mediaeval doctors believe the illness was caused by an imbalance of the four humours. This theory developed further into a more complex system based on the position of the stars. When human dissection was carried out within medical schools findings were interpreted as the theory of the four humours. Although later on doctors began to challenge this traditional understanding.</p>

                            <p>During this time there were many new developments within medicine. More schools were built and human dissection was allowed. One of the new techniques was diagnosis by urine sample. Doctors also believed that stars caused disease and relied on astrology when deciding on treatments. Doctors were very expensive during this time so medicine that was practiced was then provided by the monasteries and housewife physicians using traditional cures and their experience.</p>

                            <p>Due to the strong presence the church had during this period it was more widely believed that illness was punishment for sins and that they would need to pray to god if they became ill. Doctors also had superstitious beliefs and this is known because they would often say magical words when treating patients and often consulted the starts before deciding on treatment.</p>
